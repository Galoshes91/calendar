# TODO list
    Implement a room and car booking system
    Implement a program management system (could implement it alongside the calendar)
    Implement a DB or something to allow for more dynamic ability to add cars/rooms to the booking system. This can also make it easier to perhaps write an app that people can use to add rooms/cars

# Notes
    Thinking might be worth removing the built in calendar and appointment bookings in the side
    bar as I would say they just use Outlook for that stuff
